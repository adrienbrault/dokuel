/**
 * The dragged digit, rendered as a small chip that tracks the pointer
 * in real-time. On touch it's lifted clear of the fingertip (so the
 * finger doesn't occlude the cell being aimed at); on mouse/pen the
 * lift is zero and the chip sits right at the cursor.
 *
 * The chip is a transit cursor, not a preview. Once the pointer is
 * over a valid cell, the chip dims to a quiet position marker and
 * sheds its digit — the cell draws its own landing preview, animating
 * the digit toward the note or value slot. The digit decouples from
 * the chip so it is never shown in two places at once. The chip turns
 * red (digit kept) over a cell that can't accept the digit, since no
 * cell preview leads there.
